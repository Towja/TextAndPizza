Here are some guides for some tasks:

##Making Rooms
While currently incomplete, one should be able to type "worldbuild" into the
<br />command box in the game, before loading a game to get the world building window.

#Bugs
[BUG02]: The room exit combo boxes will not change to the correct room exits, which can cause problems.

###Note
Not all of these bugs have unknown reasons, some we just have not gotten around to fixing yet.

#Solved Bugs
[BUG01]: Entity health box will accept letters, which causes problems. <br />
[BUG03]: The east, south & west room exit combo boxes do not actually change the room exits.
