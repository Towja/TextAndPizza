# TextAndPizza
##Making Worlds
Launch text and pizza, then type "worldbuild" without the quotes into the command box. Once you have done <br />
that, you can use the GUI to design your world. Keep in mind there are still a few bugs. to watch out for. <br />
Click file > New World to create a new world, or File > Open World... to open up a ".tapwf" file and continue working on a world <br />
###Rooms
To make a room, all you need to do is click Add > Room then type in the room ID (Make sure this is unique). <br />
Once you have done that, just click Add Room. You can then customise the settings through the GUI.
###Items & Entities
Follow the same procedure for rooms, except click on Item or Entity. The items and entities appear in a <br />
smaller tab box in the lower right of the window. You can switch between them and edit their properties.
###Saving vs. Exporting
You will notice that you can click File > Save... AND File > Export... The difference between these is that saving <br />
will save as a ".tapwf" (Text and Pizza world file) which can be edited in the worldbuilder, whereas exporting will save <br />
it as a ".tapsv" (Text and Pizza save) which can be played through the text and pizza game window.
###NOTE:
Make sure you save, because it is not automatic.
#Bugs
[BUG04]: When you add a new room to a world, the room that you previously had selected gets it's exits reset.
###Note
Not all of these bugs have unknown reasons, some we just have not gotten around to fixing yet.
#Solved Bugs
[BUG01]: Entity health box will accept letters, which causes problems. <br />
[BUG03]: The east, south & west room exit combo boxes do not actually change the room exits.
[BUG02]: The room exit combo boxes will not change to the correct room exits, which can cause problems.
